As shown in Figure 3, the landing gear system is composed of three parts: (i) a mechanical part which contains all the mechanical devices and the three landing sets, (ii )a digital part including the control software, and (iii) a pilot interface.
To command the retraction and outgoing of gears, an Up/Down handle is provided to the pilot. 
When the handle is switched to “Up” the retracting landing gear sequence is executed, when the handle is switched to “Down” the extending landing gear sequence is executed.
The pilot has a set of lights giving the current position of gears and doors, and the current health state of the system and its equipments. 
These lights are: (i) one green light: “gears are locked down”, (ii) one orange light: “gears maneuvering”, (iii) one red light: “landing gear system failure”.
No light is on when the gears are locked up. 
In case of failure, the pilot can manually activate the emergency hydraulic circuit. 
The expected consequence of this action is to lock the gears in the down position. 
In case of success and if the corresponding sensors are still working, the green light “gears are locked down” must be on.
The architecture of the hydraulic part is described in Figure 4. 
Each of the of three landing sets (front, left and right) has got: (i) a landing gear uplock box, and (ii) a door with two latching boxes in the closed position.
The landing gears and doors motion is performed by a set of actuating cylinders.  
The  cylinder  position  corresponds  to  the  door  or  landing  gear  position (when a door is open, the corresponding cylinder is extended). 
The landing system has the following actuating cylinders:
- For each door, a cylinder opens and closes the door.
- For each landing gear, a cylinder retracts and extends the landing gear.

Hydraulic power is provided to the cylinders by a set of electro-valves:
- One general electro-valve which supplies the specific electro-valves with hydraulic power from the aircraft hydraulic circuit.
- One electro-valve that sets pressure on the portion of the hydraulic circuit related to door opening.
– One electro-valve that sets pressure on the portion of the hydraulic circuit related to door closing.
– One electro-valve that sets pressure on the portion of the hydraulic circuit related to landing gear extending.
– One electro-valve that sets pressure on the portion of the hydraulic circuit related to the landing gear retracting.
Each electro-valve is activated by an electrical order coming from the digital part. 
In the specific case of the general electro-valve, this electrical order goes through an analogical switch in order to prevent abnormal behavior of the digital part (e.g. abnormal activation of the general electro-valve).
Note that the three doors (resp. gears) are controlled simultaneously by the same electro-valve. 
Put differently, it is not possible to control the doors (resp. gears) separately.

A set of discrete sensors inform the digital part about the state of the equipments:
- Front / right / left gear is locked / not locked in the extended position.
- Front / right / left gear is locked / not locked in the retracted position.
- Front / right / left gear shock absorber is on ground / in flight.
- Front / right / left door is in open / not open position.
- Front / right / left door is locked / not locked in the closed position.
- The hydraulic circuit (after the general electro-valve) is pressurized / not pressurized.
– The analogical switch between the digital part and the general electro-valve
is closed / open.

In order to prevent sensor failures, each sensor is triplicated (i.e. each sensor is divided into three independent micro-sensors). 
It delivers simultaneously three discrete values describing the same situation (for instance “the left gear is locked in retracted position”).

The digital part is composed of two identical computing modules (see Figure 5). 
Each one executes in parallel the same control software. 
This software is in charge of controlling gears and doors, of detecting anomalies, and of informing the pilot about the global state of the system and anomalies (if any). 
It is part of a retroaction loop with the physical system, and produces commands for the distribution elements of the hydraulic system with respect to the sensors values and the pilot orders. 
The two computing modules receive the same inputs. 

These inputs are (remember that all the inputs are triplicated):
– handlei ∈ {up, down} i = 1, 2, 3
handlei characterizes the position of the handle. 
If the handle is UP (resp. DOWN), then handlei = up (resp. handlei = down).
– analogical switchi ∈ {open, closed} i = 1, 2, 3
analogical switchi characterizes the position of the analogical switch: open or closed. 
– gear extendedi [x] ∈ {true, false} i = 1, 2, 3, x in {front, right, left}
– gear retractedi [x] ∈ {true, false} i = 1, 2, 3, x in {front, right, left}
gear extendedi [x] is true if the corresponding gear is locked in the extended position and false in the other case.
gear retractedi [x] is true if the corresponding gear is locked in the retracted position and false in the other case (see Figure 11).
– gear shock absorberi [x] ∈ {ground, flight} i = 1, 2, 3, x in {front, right, left}
gear shock absorberi [x] is returned by a sensor implemented directly on the corresponding gear (see Figure 11). 
It is true if and only if the aircraft is on ground.
– door closedi [x] ∈ {true, false} i = 1, 2, 3, x in {front, right, left}
– door openi [x] ∈ {true, false} i = 1, 2, 3, x in {front, right, left}
door closedi [x] is true if and only if the corresponding door is locked closed.
door openi [x] is true if and only if the corresponding door is locked open (see Figure 12).
– circuit pressurizedi ∈ {true, false} i = 1, 2, 3
circuit pressurizedi is returned by a pressure sensor on the hydraulic circuit between the general electro-valve and the maneuvering electro-valve (see Figure 4). 
circuit pressurizedi is true if and only if the pressure is high in this part of the hydraulic circuit.
The total amount of input discrete values received by each computing module is 54 (3 handle, 3 analogical switch, 9 gear extended, 9 gear retracted, 9 gear shock absorber, 9 door closed, 9 door open and 3 circuit pressurized).
From these inputs, each module computes 5 electrical orders for the electrovalves:
– general EVk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
– close EVk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
– open EVk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
– retract EVk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
– extend EVk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
where “EV” stands for “Electro-Valve” and 
k stands for the number of the considered computing module. 
These corresponding electrical orders outgoing from the two modules are physically produced on the same electrical line. 
The implicit composition of two outputs is an electrical “OR” as shown in Figure 5. 
For instance, let us consider the general EV parameter. 
If the two modules produce the same value on general EV1 and general EV2 , then this value is produced to the general electro-valve. 
Otherwise, if only one of them is true (because of a failure somewhere in the digital part), then the value true is produced to the electro-valve, even if it is not the correct value. 
The problem will anyway be detected at the next cycle when the module that produced the false value will detect an unexpected behavior with respect to its own orders. 
Then it will inform the pilot of a potential anomaly in the system.
Similarly the two modules produce global boolean state variables to the cockpit:
– gears locked downk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
– gears maneuveringk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
– anomalyk ∈ {true, false} k = 1, 2
These outputs are synthesized by each module from sensors data and from the situation awareness. 
Similarly to electrical orders provided to the electro-valves, the boolean state variables from the two modules are composed following a logical “OR” operation. 
If gears locked downk (for some k) is sent to the pilot interface with the value true, then the green light “gears are locked down” is on.
If gears maneuveringk (for some k) is sent to the pilot interface with the value true, then the orange light “gears maneuvering” is on. 
If anomalyk (for some k) is sent to the pilot interface with the value true, then the red light “landing gear system failure” is on. 
The output interface of each module is synthesized on Figure 6.
