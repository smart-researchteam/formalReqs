The  landing  system  is  in  charge  of  maneuvering  landing  gears  and  associated  doors.  
The  landing  system  is  composed  of  3  landing  sets:  front,  left  and right. 
Each landing set contains a door, a landing-gear and associated hydraulic cylinders (see Fig. 1). 
The system is controlled digitally in nominal mode and analogically in emergency mode. 
In this case study, we do not consider the emergency mode. 
However, in order to allow the pilot to activate the emergency command, the system has to elaborate health parameters for all the equipments involved in the landing gear function. 
This health monitoring part is in the scope of the case study.
In nominal mode, the landing sequence is: open the doors of the landing gearboxes, extend the landing gears and close the doors. This sequence is illustrated in Figure 2.
After taking off, the retraction sequence to be performed is: open the doors, retract the landing gears and close the doors.
