Because of hydraulic constraints, timing constraints must be satisfied by the control software.
Because of inertia of the oil pressure,
– stimulations of the general electro-valve and of the maneuvering electro-valve must be separated by at least 200ms,
– orders to stop the stimulation of the general electro-valve and of the maneuvering electro-valve must be separated by at least 1s.
Because of inertia of the oil pressure,
– two contrary orders (closure / opening doors, extension / retraction gears) must be separated by at least 100ms.
