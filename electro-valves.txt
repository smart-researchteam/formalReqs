All the electro-valves are supposed to have the same behavior. 
As shown in Figure 9, an electro-valve is an hydraulic equipment which has got two hydraulic ports Hin (hydraulic input port) and Hout (hydraulic output port), and an electrical port (E ∈ {true, textitf alse).
Its behavior depends on the value of the electrical order connected to E.
– if E = false (the voltage of the electrical order is down), then Hout = 0 (no pressure on the hydraulic output side, the hydraulic circuit is open);
– if E = true (the voltage of the electrical order is high), then Hout = Hin (the hydraulic circuit is closed);
Note that the electrical order must be sustained to true (i..e, at the high voltage) to maintain the electro-valve in the closed position. 
Put differently, the electrical order is not a discrete event, but can be seen as an analogical signal.
Because of inertial reasons, we suppose that from the open position to the closed position, the pressure grows up continuously from 0 to Hin. 
In this case study we suppose that the pressure grows up linearly, and that the total duration of the transition phase is 1 second. 
In the same way, the pressure goes down continuously from Hin to 0. 
We suppose that the pressure goes down linearly, and that the total duration of the transition phase is 3,6 seconds.
In addition to this normal behavior, any electro-valve can fail. 
We consider only permanent failures: the electro-valve remains blocked in the closed or the open state. 
A failure can occur at any time.
