This project aims at precisely define the requirements for a particular system: the **L**anding **G**ear **S**ystem (LGS).
This system has been described in 2014 by Frédéric Boniol and Virginie Wiels for the purpose of comparing modelsation techniques.
Main problem is that the document is not really a requirements document as such.

== Description of the case study

Here's the description of the LGS.

The following text contains the initial description of the case study (cf. <<source>>) but where each line has a number for further traceability feature.

TIP: Thanks to this, one can reference in a documentation or a model to the precise line number such as, e.g., {projectURL}/blob/master/architecture.txt#L1 !

=== System organisation

We will have to organise the system in levels.

Here are some examples of model organisation in SysML:

== Project description

You will be working by teams of two (please fill the following link:{teamsURL}[shared document]).
Each team will have to 

. propose a requirement document, as you learned how to do it in the main course ({cours}),
. propose a Stimulus version and analysis of the requirements through a report + source files.

Each team will have its own branch (with the team name as naming root if many branches are used).

The report should be in Asciidoc or Markdown format, pointing eventually to shared documents.

=== Things to be done

. Individually, install {stimulus} on your Windows computer:
.. Launch the {stimulus} installer
.. Generate the number required for the licence
.. Send the email as required in order to get the licence file (for next course)
. Add your group in the shared document: {teamsURL}
. Read the <<source>> document
. Organise the requirements according to the _Vision et Périmètre_ document studied in {cours} (=> 4h TD 5/11)
+
TIP: For the section you are not able to complete, identify the activities (elicitation, analysis, v&v, ...) and actions (questions, inqueries, ...) that they would require.
+
. Install and play with the Stimulus tool through the tutorial (=> 4h TD 7/11)
. Implements (parts of) the requirements in Stimulus (=> 4h TD 14/11 morning)
. Work on your reports / Finalize documents and push in repo (=> 2h TD 14/11 afternoon)

=== Evaluation

- The requirement document will be evaluated by Pierre-Jean Charrel as done in "TD".
- The Stimulus report will be evaluated by Jean-Michel Bruel and the consistency and pertinence of the requirements will be mainly analysed.

== Git Rules

=== Workflow

. Fork the repo

. Create Branch
.. Create Parent Branch
- `groupName`/`issueName` (ex: `JMB_PJC/globalArchitecture`)
.. Create Child Branch
- `groupName`/`issueName`/`taskName` (ex: `JMB_PJC/globalArchitecture/changeNameTitle`)

. Merge Request
- Add a Template
- Title: Task name (ex: `Change name title`)
- Put "WIP: " in front of your title if unfinished (ex: `WIP: Change name title`)
- Description: Tracking: #`issue id`
- Description: Description: Make it clear and concise
- Assign yourself
- Use labels
- 1 Approval required from me

=== Useful commands
